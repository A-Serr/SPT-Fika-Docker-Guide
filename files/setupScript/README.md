# Automatic Setup ( READ THIS V )
This script creates the directories and dockerfiles automatically for you.
You should only use it if you've already once done the regular setup. 
This script only creates the file structure and it does not create a new user or automatically start the docker as you have to configure the mod versions manually.

I just quickly setup this and can't really guarantee it will work.
